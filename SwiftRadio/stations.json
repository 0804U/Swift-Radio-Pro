     "longDesc": "Michael's interest in covers started at a young age, and like all great things in life, should be attributed to the Simpsons. Sometimes it's a song that you always thought was the original, only to learn that it too is a cover; other times it's an entirely new take on a beloved standard or a respun pop tune. "

     "longDesc": "I've always been fascinated by space exploration, since I was a very young kid watching the Moon landing on a 9\" black and white TV. So when NASA celebrated the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11 by rebroadcasting the mission audio in real time, but 40 years delayed in July of 2009, I knew that SomaFM had to add a soundtrack to it. That's how our Mission Control channel started."
